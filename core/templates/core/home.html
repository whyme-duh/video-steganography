            <h3>WHAT IS VIDEO STEGANOGRAPHY?</h3>
            <p>Video steganography is a branch of data hiding, which is a technique that embeds message into cover
                contents and is used in many fields such as medical systems, law enforcement, copyright protection and
                access control, etc.<br><br>
                Since human visual system are less sensitive to the small changes of digital medias, especially for
                digital video, video steganography is a technique which hides message into a video and conceals the fact
                of the transmission. And it has become more popular recently because of two main reasons: Along with the
                fast development of computer applications, the security problem in information field is becoming more
                and more serious.

            <h3>WHAT IS IMAGE STEGANOGRAPHY?</h3>
            <p>
                Image steganography is a method of hiding secret data within a digital image, aiming for secure communication by making the existence of the 
                message undetectable. It involves embedding information in an image by subtly altering its digital data, which remains largely imperceptible 
                to the human eye.<br><br>
                
                The applications of image steganography are diverse, ranging from secure communication to digital watermarking. In secure communication, 
                sensitive information is transmitted without drawing attention, making it a crucial tool in the digital era where data privacy is a 
                significant concern. Unlike traditional cryptography that only hides the content of a message, steganography conceals the existence 
                of the message itself. In digital watermarking, creators embed a hidden mark in an image to assert copyright ownership, 
                helping prevent unauthorized copying or distribution. However, steganography also poses ethical and security challenges.
